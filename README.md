# Portfolio with React

In this project I've used the base from my portfolio and recreated it with React. We got this project as an assignment in Tech for Women (spring 2022) and I decided to work at it some more. I will keep on working with it and perhaps decide to use this version instead of my current one, but we will see.

I also inserted a modal (since this was part of the assignment in TfW)
